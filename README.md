### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I enjoy working across the entire stack and like strengthing my knowledge in as many areas of web development as I can. 

I have developed application ranging from discord bots, interactive livestreams, sass products and more.

I love a good well crafted interactive tutorial. 

Most recently I have really enjoyed developing apps with the so called t3 stack.

When I'm not working on a project or trying to upskill...  I like to disconnect and take spontaneous walks, meditate.
